## I am learning how to use Git branches and pull requests.

## .gitignore pattern
- This file skips saving temporary or automatically created files so it stays neat and easy to manage.

## Branches Use Cases
- author/idea-sprint: for trying out ideas and writing first drafts.
- editor/review: for making edits and getting the work ready to publish.
